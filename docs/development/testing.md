# Testing

The native regression executables check event scheduling, clock wrap and reset,
video event deadlines, CPU dispatch coverage, SWI exception entry, arithmetic
boundaries, block transfers, I/O dispatch bounds, signed audio samples, and
affine reference registers. Checks remain enabled in release builds.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCUPID_BUILD_FRONTEND=OFF
cmake --build build --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Use `-DCUPID_SANITIZERS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` on Linux with GCC or Clang
to run address and undefined behavior checks. Compiler warnings are errors.

The optional ROM checks use a pinned manifest of ARM, Thumb, and memory tests.
Fetch the inputs, then configure their location:

```sh
python3 tests/roms/check_rom.py --fetch --directory .local-research/test-roms
cmake -S . -B build -DCUPID_TEST_ROM_DIR="$PWD/.local-research/test-roms"
cmake --build build --parallel 2
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Each input's SHA-256 digest must match the manifest. The runner must reach the
ROM's specified terminal branch and observe zero in its result register. A
timeout, mismatched input, crash, or nonzero test number fails the check. The
runner uses the same CPU and GBA core as the SDL2 application.

To run another authorized input for a fixed number of frames:

```sh
./build/cupidgba-headless /path/to/game.gba --bios /path/to/gba-bios.bin \
  --frames 600 --screenshot .local-research/frame.ppm
```

The headless runner does not load or write disk saves. Its screenshot is the
native 240x160 framebuffer, written as a binary PPM file. Step and emulated-cycle
budgets bound execution; `--expect-loop-register` reports the result register
at an ARM branch to itself. `--terminal-address` restricts that observation to
a specific instruction address.

Passing these checks establishes the listed cases. They do not cover every CPU
encoding, exact bus cycles, DMA arbitration, timer register latency, raster
effects, audio fidelity, cartridge peripherals, save persistence, or link
behavior. Those require further regressions and hardware-backed evidence.
